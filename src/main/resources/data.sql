Sprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more salt. Arrange the chicken pieces in the pan so that all the pieces are skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of the pan. Dont crowd the pan; allow room in between the pieces.</p>
            <li>Bake the chicken:</li>
            <p>Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400°F (205°C). This initial high heat will help brown the chicken. Then lower the heat to 350°F (175°C) and bake for an additional 10-30 minutes until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165°F (74°C), and of the thighs is 170°F (77°C) when tested with a meat thermometer. If the chicken isnt browning well enough, place the chicken under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.</p>

            <p>If you would like to make gravy with the drippings from the chicken, place the roasting pan with all its drippings on the stovetop and set the burner to medium heat. Use a metal spatula to scrape up the stuck drippings from the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot, pour in some white wine or chicken stock to help loosen the drippings from the pan. Transfer the drippings and stock/wine mixture to a saucepan and heat on medium high until reduced to your desired thickness. If you want the gravy even thicker, you can make a slurry with a little cornstarch or flour (a teaspoon) and water (1/4 cup), and add that to the gravy while it cooks.</p>

            <p>Lay the bacon slices on one of the baking sheets. Cook the bacon, until crispy and to your liking, rotating the pan halfway through cooking if necessary, and checking for doneness at about 12 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper-towel lined plate to drain excess grease.</p>
            <li>Toast the bread and assemble the sandwiches:</li>
            <p>Toast 4 slices of bread in a toaster, toaster oven, or regular oven. On the remaining baking sheet place two slices of toast side by side in a single layer. Cut the other two slices of toast on a diagonal to form triangles and set those pieces aside. Cut four slices of tomato. Divide the turkey evenly between the slices of toast on the baking sheet. Top each stack of turkey with two slices of tomato. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

            <p>Set a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter. Once it melts, slowly whisk in the flour and continue to whisk until the mixture turns a shade darker and begins to smell slightly nutty, about 1 minute. This will allow the raw flour taste to cook out. Slowly pour in the milk and cream, whisking constantly, until the mixture is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes. When you first start pouring in the liquid, it will look ugly and grainy. Dont worry! It will calm down, come back together and smooth itself out once all of the liquid is whisked in.</p>
            <li>Remove from heat and add the cheese:</li>
            <p>Remove from heat and add the cheese: Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the cheese, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Whisk to combine until the cheese melts. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary, keeping in mind the saltiness of your turkey. Spoon half of the sauce over each sandwich.</p>

            <p>With a spatula, transfer each sandwich and two triangles of toast to a plate. Spoon the remaining sauce from the baking dish onto the plates. Crisscross 2 slices of bacon over top each sandwich and garnish with parsley. Serve while still hot.</p>
